# Registration Form with Node.js and MongoDB

This is a simple registration form project that demonstrates the integration of HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB. Users can register by providing a username, email, and password. The user data is stored in a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/registration-form.git
   cd registration-form
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the MongoDB server:

   Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine. You can start it with the following command:

   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

4. Start the Node.js server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the registration form.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: HTML file containing the registration form.
- **`styles.css`**: CSS file for styling the registration form.
- **`server.js`**: Node.js file that sets up an Express server and handles form submissions. It connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.

## Dependencies

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Web framework for Node.js.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/): MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- [Body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser): Node.js body parsing middleware.

## Additional Notes

- This is a basic example intended for learning purposes. In a production environment, you should implement additional security measures, input validation, and error handling.
- Ensure MongoDB is properly configured and running on your machine.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please create an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
